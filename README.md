# NTL initiative: Facts and insights  

NTL is an initiative from the Egyptian ministry of telecommunications  
to help graduates take online course for free as a grant  
provided that the student finish his/her course before a deadline  
I scraped the data of graduates using the script [ntl_extract.py](ntl_extract.py)  
and made a Tableau story about it to highlight important insights out  
the original site from which I scraped the data is: [ntl wall of fame](http://techleaders.eg/wall-of-fame/)

run the script on any place on your machine  
and it will produce the dataset for you named `ntl_data.csv`
